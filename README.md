## Mouji
_Performs a random mouse action on an interval to avoid screen locking_

## Why?
This script was originally written to help with presentations. After having the presentation computer go to sleep over and over and being unable to change screen lock settings on work computers, I wrote this little script to help everyone out.

## Usage
Command line options can be found by running `mouji -h`. Just running `mouji` will move the mouse between 1 and 5 pixels every 60 seconds.
